# [Exercise] Class Constructors

In this exercise we will do the following:

* Fork a Github repository
* Clone a Git repository into your Projects folder
* Create class properties
* Create a constructor
* Implement a method
* Run tests

## Instructions

1. Go to Github and create a fork of [this repository](https://github.com/tiy-raleigh-java/classes-in-java-class-constructors). This will create a copy of this repository in your Github account named `classes-in-java-class-constructors`.

2. Open a new Terminal session.

3. Change into your Projects directory using the `cd` command:

	`cd ~/Projects`

4. Clone your forked repository using the `git clone` command:

	`git clone git@github.com:<your github username>/classes-in-java-class-constructors.git`

	**Warning:** Be sure to replace `<your github username>` in the command above with your actual Github username.

	This should create a new directory at `~/Projects/classes-in-java-class-constructors`.

5. Open this project in IntelliJ

6. Find the `Main` class, open it, and follow the instructions in the comments therein.

7. When you're ready to run this code, select "Run all test (All in classes-in-java-class-constructors)" in the drop down menu at the top of the screen and click the green Run button to the right.

8. When the tests pass, then you're done!

9. Commit your code and push it to Github.

10. Finally, submit the link to your repository using the 'Submit Assignment' form below.
