# [Exercise] Class Constructors

In this exercise we will do the following:

* Clone a Git repository into your Projects folder
* Create class properties
* Create a constructor
* Implement a method
* Run tests

## Instructions

1. Start by opening a new Terminal session.

2. Change into your Projects directory using the `cd` command:

	`cd ~/Projects`

3. Clone [this repository](https://github.com/tiy-raleigh-java/classes-in-java-class-constructors) using the `git clone` command:

	`git clone git@github.com:tiy-raleigh-java/classes-in-java-class-constructors.git`

	This should create a new directory at `~/Projects/classes-in-java-class-constructors`.

4. Open this project in IntelliJ

5. Find the `Main` class, open it, and follow the instructions in the comments therein.

6. When you're ready to run this code, select "Run all test (All in classes-in-java-class-constructors)" in the drop down menu at the top of the screen and click the green Run button to the right.

7. If the tests pass, then you're done!
